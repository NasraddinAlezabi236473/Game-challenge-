      "Clau-Hee says: You think you're sneaky, don't you? Trying to sneak a gift under the radar without anyone knowing. Well, let me tell you, my friend, that's not how it works here. According to our beloved Gift Policy (because who doesn't love a good policy?), gifts must be given openly and transparently. Secrecy is like trying to hide a red light in a room full of green lights - it just won't fly.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, kudos to you for answering correctly that giving a gift in secret isn't acceptable, even if the value is under the threshold. You're one step closer to escaping the game without getting caught... I mean, without violating the Gift Policy. Keep going, and maybe (just maybe) you'll make it out alive! What's your next question?\n",

      "\n",
      "But, alas, it seems you actually did know what you were doing. Donations are indeed made without expecting any quid pro quo (though I'm sure our lovely HR department would love to throw in some swag or recognition as a nice-to-have).\n",
